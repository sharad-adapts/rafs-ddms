  "description": "Gas chromatography (GC) is the process of separating compounds in a mixture by injecting a gaseous or liquid sample into a mobile phase, typically called the carrier gas, and passing the gas through a stationary phase. The mobile phase is usually an inert gas or unreactive gas such as helium, argon, nitrogen or hydrogen. The stationary phase is contained inside of a separation column. Today, most GC columns are fused silica capillaries with an inner diameter of 100-320 Î¼m and a length of 5-60 m. The GC column is located inside an oven where the temperature of the gas can be controlled and the effluent coming off the column is monitored by a suitable detector as a function of retention time.",
